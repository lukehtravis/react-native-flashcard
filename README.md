# flash cards

This application lives on expo snack here 
https://snack.expo.io/@lukehtravis/flash-cards  

The back-end is run on heroku using a hasura / graphiql cloud based database which lives here 
https://flashcardsreact.herokuapp.com/v1alpha1/graphql
More information about this can be found belowhttps://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/getting-started/heroku-simple.html

The project could be bootstrapped with create-react-native-app and expo-cli tools, for which documentation can be found here. 
https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app

Database queries are executed through apollo-boost and graph-ql, and more information about that can be found below
